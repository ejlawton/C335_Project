Ethan Lawton  | April 29, 2016 | Final Project



Tasks: 

Both me and my partner largely did everything together, but we did do some work on our own. When I was working on my own, I had taken care of a lot of the graphical portions of the final project. Along with that, I created the functions responsible for generating the structural foundation for the board and the game itself. 

Challenges: 

We encountered a lot of challenges along the way. It was really just one bug after another the entire time. Nothing took as much time as finding a board, making sure it was wired properly, finding a working nunchuk, finding a working SD card, etc. That probably was almost 25% of our time spent working on this project. There wasn't really anything groundbreaking problem that we encountered that was going to potentially throw things off, just a few bugs here and there involving mine display, audio retrieval from the SD card, etc.

Differently:

I really can't think of anything, we started right as soon as we could, and we continued to work on the project steadily through the 2 week period we had. So I would say we did things largely correct.
