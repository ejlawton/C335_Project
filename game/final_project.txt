Ethan Lawton + Anna Branam | April 29, 2016 | Final Project

Description:

We recreated Minesweeper. Essentially, it is a puzzle game where the objective is to reveal all of the tiles that don't have mines underneath them. On startup, 10 mines are randomly placed underneath 10 tiles, and if you reveal a tile with a mine underneath, you lose the game. The nunchuk is used to navigate the board and the main menu, the user button is used to reset the game, and the LCD displays the game itself. We have a main menu where you can see the rules, the controls, and to play the game. There is a victory and a loss screen, and sounds that match each of those situations. There are also sounds for placing a flag on a tile, as well as starting the game. 

Task Breakdown:

Most of the work was completed by both partners at the same time, however, there were portions where we worked on parts of it alone. There wasn't exactly a "splitting of work" in place, but we did make sure that we were both doing our fair share of the workload for the final project. 

     Tasks: 
     	    - screen.c 
	      - displays the main menu options 
	    - game_play.c
	      - controls game functionality (rules of the game)
	    - main.c
	      - runs the game initially 
	    - board.c
	      - generates the structure for the game 
	      - generates the board and individual tiles
	    - controls.c 
	      - interface for sounds and nunchuk interaction
	    - Graphics (in board.c)
